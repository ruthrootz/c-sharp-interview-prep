# C#/.NET interview prep

- [x] types of programming
    - declarative: *what* to execute
    - imperative: *how* to execute
    - procedural/structured: defines each step of the program
    - functional: avoids state and mutable data
- [x] four OOP principles
    - encapsulation: each instance of an object has its own protected data
    - abstraction: you don't have to know how the class works, just what you can do with it
    - inheritance: classes can inherit other classes in order not to duplicate methods/properties across multiple classes
    - polymorphism: use the same logic for multiple types, e.g. generics
- [x] OOP explained with a car analogy
    - the objects: Vehicle made up of NumberOfWheels, MPG, etc.
    - the methods: Drive(), Refuel()
    - child classes inherit from Vehicle and define specific vehicle types (Truck, Car, Motorcycle, etc.)
        - each child class has additional fields, including CarType enum for cars, TowingCapacity for trucks, etc.
        - the constructor for each child class defines a default NumberOfWheels
- [x] what is CLR?
    - it manages running the code and does garbage collection, etc.
- [x] managed vs. unmanaged code
    - managed code, like C#, is code that is managed by the CLR during runtime
    - unmanaged code, like C, is not (duh)
- [x] abstract vs. interface
    - an abstract can have defined methods that can be overridden by the inheriting class
    - interfaces don't implement methods, they have to be each implemented in the inheriting classes
    - neither can be instantiated
- [x] struct vs. class
    - used to define your own value type
    - they're technically objects, but they act like value types
- [x] ref vs. out
    - ref designates an argument as a reference value, so the object doesn't have to be returned, it's changed in the function
    - out takes a variable (that doesn't have to be instantiated) and assigns whatever the return value is to that variable
- [x] what are extension methods?
    - you can define static methods to add to an existing class
- [ ] what are generics?
- [x] list the accessibility modifiers
    - public
    - private
    - protected: only classes that inherit can use them
- [x] what is a virtual method?
    - mark a method as allowed to be overridden
- [x] value vs. reference types
    - reference types live in memory and variables point to the objects
    - value types live in the stack
- [x] does C# support multiple inheritance? if not, what's a work-around for that?
    - no
    - you can use multiple interfaces
    - you can chain classes to inherit from each other
- [x] what is boxing and unboxing?
    - boxing: value -> reference type
    - unboxing: reference -> value with explicit conversion
- [ ] what are partial classes?
- [ ] what are sealed classes?
- [ ] late vs. early binding
- [ ] what are indexers?
- [x] == vs. Equals()
    - with reference objects, == checks if the addresses are the same, if the variables point to the same object
    - Equals() checks if the values of the objects are the same
- [x] is vs. as operators
    - is checks compatibility
    - as forces the object to be another class
- [ ] what are different ways a method can be overloaded?
- [ ] what is reflection?
- [ ] const vs. readonly
- [ ] String vs. StringBuilder
- [ ] IEnumerable vs. IQueryable
- [ ] what is LINQ?
- [ ] what are accessors?
- [ ] what are indexers?
- [ ] dispose vs. finalize
- [ ] what are delegates?
- [ ] what is a multicast delegate?
- [ ] what is constructor chaining?
- [ ] Array.CopyTo() vs. Array.Clone()
- [ ] throw exception vs. throw clause
- [ ] what is an object pool in .NET?
- [ ] what is serialization?
- [ ] describe the singleton design pattern
- [ ] describe the MVC pattern
- [ ] describe the design pattern we use at work
